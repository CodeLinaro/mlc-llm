Deploy
======

MLC-LLM offers deployment options for targets. Once the model is compiled for Adrenouâ„¢ GPU target with platform Android (or Linux) or Windows we have the folder containg model params (with some configs) and the library.


We have options like Web, REST API, CLI, Python API, Android SDK ...etc. Please refer `Deploy <https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/deploy/webllm.html>`_ to know more about integration and deployment options.
